## Teaching assiatant experience 
1. 2020, Fall Advanced Mathematics, FDU
2. 2021, Fall Graph Theory, FDU
3. 2022, Fall Graph Theory, FDU

## Publication
[The Betti Number of the Independence Complex of Ternary Graphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.10939), 2021, Hehui Wu and Wentao Zhang, to appear in JEMS

## Research Interests: 
Graph theory, Combinatorics and Optimazation. I'm especially interested in structual graph theory problems originating from the real world. Examples include calculation of Shannon capacity and pagenumber of graphs.
